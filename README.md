# Pomodoro App
This app is based on the learning technique "Pomodoro" which helps you stop procrastination and to be more productive. 
You work for 25 minutes then take 5 minutes break for 4 times. Then you'll have a long break and start over.

In this app you can set the task you currently working on by selecting one from the task list. 
Also you can add or remove a task from the list.

You have the opportunity to set the work and break(s) time. I recommend to stick with the original (25m, 5m) at the beginning.
